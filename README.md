# Letter Drop

## Game Overview
**Letter Drop** is an interactive typing game where random letters (`A–Z`) fall from the top of the screen.  
The player must type the correct key on the keyboard to catch the letter.

- **Win / Lose Condition**:  
  If the player misses or fails to type the correct key 5 times, the game ends and the final score is displayed.  
  Pay attention: the grey letters are danger letters. Once the player clicks it, the game ends immediately!
- **Background**:  
  Designed to replace boring typing drills with a more engaging activity, similar to *Fruit Ninja*.

## Core Mechanics
- Random letters are generated and fall from the top of the screen.  
- `letterInterval` controls how often new letters spawn; this interval decreases over time to increase difficulty.  
- `animationDuration` shortens as `speedMultiplier` increases, making letters fall faster.
